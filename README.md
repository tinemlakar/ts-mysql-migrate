# ts-mysql-migrate

MySQL migration tool for typescript projects. Supports mysqljs and node-mysql2 driver.

## IMPORTANT NOTICE

This code is work in progress. Please test your upgrade and downgrade scripts well before use it on production database!

## Installation

```ssh
npm i ts-mysql-migrate
```

## API

### initialize()

Ensures database connectivity and creates migration table on database, if not yet present. Must be awaited before running migration scripts.

### up(step: number)

Upgrades database by running upgrade functions in migration scripts. Parameter ```step``` defines number of versions to upgrade which is number of migration scripts to execute. If omitted, all not-yet-deployed upgrade functions will execute - database will upgrade to last version.

### down(step: number = 1)

Runs downgrade functions in migration scripts. Parameter ```step``` defines how many versions should database downgrade. If omitted, one downgrade functions will be executed - database will downgrade one version.

### reset()

Runs all downgrade and upgrade migrations. Depending od your upgrade and downgrade scripts, this could be used to clean database of all data.

### destroy()

Closes database connection and releases handles.

## Guide

### Create migration scripts

Create migration scripts and name them with number prefix to set the order of execution (versions). Each migration script should have ```upgrade``` and ```downgrade``` functions exported. These functions must have ```queryFn``` as parameter - see examples below.

 Example: ```/src/migrations/1-init_db.ts```

 ```ts
 export async function upgrade(queryFn: (query: string, values?: any[]) => Promise<Array<any>>) {

// write upgrade logic as parameter of queryFn
  await queryFn(`
    CREATE TABLE TEST (ID INTEGER NULL, NAME VARCHAR(20) NULL);
  `);
  
}

export async function downgrade(queryFn: (query: string, values?: any[]) => Promise<Array<any>>) {

// write downgrade logic as parameter of queryFn
  await queryFn(`
    DROP TABLE TEST;
  `);


}

 ```

 Example: ```/src/migrations/2-seed_data.ts```

 ```ts
 export async function upgrade(queryFn: (query: string, values?: any[]) => Promise<Array<any>>) {

  // write upgrade logic as parameters of queryFn
  await queryFn(`
    INSERT INTO TEST VALUES (?, ?);
  `, [1, 'Test']);

}

export async function downgrade(queryFn: (query: string, values?: any[]) => Promise<Array<any>>) {
  
  // write downgrade logic as parameters of queryFn
  await queryFn(`
    DELETE FROM TEST WHERE ID = ?;
  `, [1]);

}

```

### Create starter script

Create scripts that will run your upgrade and/or downgrade migrations. You can write multiple scripts for different scenarios/environments (dev, staging, production).

Example: ```/src/scripts/upgrade.ts``` (or ```/src/scripts/downgrade.ts```)

```ts
import { Migration, MigrationConnection } from 'ts-mysql-migrate';

const run = async () => {
  
/**** mysqljs example ****/

/*
   const poolConfig: PoolConfig = {
    host: process.env.DB_HOST,
    port: parseInt(process.env.DB_PORT),
    user: process.env.DB_USER,
    password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
    database: process.env.DB_DATABASE,

  };

  const pool = createPool(poolConfig);

  migration = new Migration({
    conn: pool,
    tableName: 'migrations',
    dir: `./src/migrations/`
  });

*/

/**** node-mysql2 example ****/

const poolConfig: ConnectionOptions = {
    host: process.env.DB_HOST,
    port: parseInt(process.env.DB_PORT),
    user: process.env.DB_USER,
    password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
    database: process.env.DB_DATABASE,
  };

  const pool = createPool(poolConfig); // make sure that you are not using mysl2/promise lib

  const migration = new Migration({
    conn: pool as unknown as mysql.Connection,
    tableName: 'migrations',
    dir: `./src/migrations/`
  });

  await migration.initialize();
  
  await migration.up();       // use for upgrade script
  // await migration.down();  // use for downgrade script
  // await migration.reset(); // use for resetting database
  await migration.destroy();  // close db connection
};

run().catch((err) => {
  console.log(err);
});

```

### Run upgrade or downgrade migrations

All you have to do now is to run your starter scripts each time you want to upgrade or downgrade a database.

You can put them in ```package.json``` and run it from npm. Example:

```package.json```

```json
  "scripts": {
    "upgrade": "node -r ts-node/register ./src/scripts/upgrade-stg.ts",
    "downgrade": "node -r ts-node/register ./src/scripts/downgrade-stg.ts",
    "upgrade-production": "node -r ts-node/register ./src/scripts/upgrade-prod.ts",
    "downgrade-production": "node -r ts-node/register ./src/scripts/downgrade-prod.ts",
  },
```
